;; Declarative selectors and operations
;; --------------------------------------
;;
;; This is an illustration of how you can use core.logic to solve generic
;; tree-oriented problems.  One such problem is applying modifications using
;; CSS-like selections of some data structure (which is tree-like or list-like).
;; This solution can be expanded or extrapolated to solve other similar problems.

;; While `core.logic` offers a very rich foundation for logic programming,
;; unification provides the necessary functionality to solve most tree-oriented
;; logic-backed solutions.  Always start with unification and evolve outward
;; when it is not enough.

;; ### The problem
;; Given a data structure like:

(def test-data {:node-type :div
                :id "root"
                :contents [{:node-type :ul
                            :contents [{:node-type :li
                                        :class "odd row"
                                        :contents "foo"}
                                       {:node-type :li
                                        :class "even row"
                                        :contents "bar"}]}]})

;; ... we want declarative selection of sub-maps/nodes based on:
;;
;; * id
;; * class
;; * node type and count
;; * node children (all elements contained in some node)
;;
;; ... and then perform data modifications at those locations.

;; Some auxiliary functions for working with the selector strings:

(defn starts-with? [s v]
  (= (subs s 0 (count v)) v))

(defn ends-with? [s v]
  (= (subs s (- (count s) (count v))) v))

;; First, normalize all "syntax" into a data structure.  The goal here is to
;; translate something declarative that humans can reason about, into something
;; data-described that computers/programs can reason about.
;; All selectors are normalized into a sequence of maps
;; with an `:op` key and a `:val` for that particular op.  Multiple maps within
;; the sequences represent multiple steps for a selection (ie: sub-selections).
;; This format will allow us to dispatch functionality based on `:op`, which
;; will allow the system to be open for extension.

(defn parse-selector [sel]
  (cond
    (keyword? sel) [{:op :node-type :val sel}]
    (vector? sel) (do (assert (every? keyword? sel) (str "Path contains non-keyword: " sel))
                      (mapv #(hash-map :op :attr :val %) sel))

    (and (string? sel)

;; From here, there are a few options:
;;
;; * Walk or match directly on the tree
;; * Normalize all nodes in the tree and unify per node
;;
;; The first one doesn't require any logic programming and should be straight
;; forward for most Clojure programmers.
;; Another option is normalizing all nodes of the tree into vectors,
;; and unifying across those vectors to match on the selector.  This approach
;; ends up looking very similar to Datomic's datalog query.
;;
;; #### So which one should we pick?
;; If you only want to do selections, walking the tree is very acceptable.
;; It's easy to write, easy to read, and extracts data as expected.
;;
;; If you want to perform operations on the tree as you go, walking won't work
;; because as you modify the tree, all further sections are broken (you changed
;; the tree).
;; To get around this, we can normalize the tree nodes, represent the updates
;; as new normalize nodes, and collapse all the normalized nodes (`reduce` and
;; build the tree back up).

;; Let's see a limited version of the naive walk-only/query-only solution first:
